## Testing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Overview

Small thing: I was looking the challenge code, and the array which I received dind't have category to create the drodpown, so instead I implemented the filter using description.

The project is divides in three components where which component is responsible for show a data and do some logics based on parent implementation, any questions
just let me know.

Basically everything is inside the root component called +page.svelte, and the other parts are broken on components childrens.
